# Arcdps-Uploader
This is an extension for Arcdps that automatically uploads EVTC combat logs *in-game*.

* Easy access to recent logs, one-click to view on dps.reports
* No network usage while you're in combat
* Discord Webhook integration

### CURRENT BUILDS MAY NO LONGER LOAD
It may simply fail to display or even crash your game on startup. Consider [Plen Bot Log Uploader](https://github.com/Plenyx/PlenBotLogUploader) as an alternative as I have no ETA for a fix. I don't have much time to maintain this project (or play GW2 for that matter) but I will get it working again at some point. PRs welcome.

## Usage
Grab the latest [release](https://github.com/datatobridge/arcdps-uploader/releases). Unzip and copy `d3d9_uploader.dll` to same directory as **Arcdps** (usually something like `C:\Program Files\Guild Wars 2\bin64`).

*If the extension fails to load, install the latest x64 ![Visual C++ redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)*

Use *Alt-Shift-U* to bring the uploader window up.

## Changelog
**1.0.1**
* Added Aleeva integration
* Contributed by @covertPZ: Additional user configuration for formatted log messages

**0.9.3**
* Use a fixed window size to prevent auto-resize feedback loop (Fixes #7)
* View button opens logs in default browser (#8)
* Auto refresh every minute instead of every two minutes

**0.9:**
- Automatically uploads logs when not in combat
- Discord Webhook integration
  - Filter by success, log type, or players present
- Removed (unmaintained) built-in parser

**0.8:**
- Cache all parsed logs to prevent any refresh delay for users with 500+ logs
- Add Wing 7 Boss Names and ID's
- Improve parsing accuracy (dps should match Elite Insights)

## ToS Compliance
This extension has minimal interaction with GW2 (basically it displays a window), and is essentially a QoL upgrade over uploading the logs yourself. It provides no inherent advantage over other players. As such, I believe it to be ToS compliant.

If you have any doubts, refer to [Arenanet's policy on Third-Party Programs](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/65547/policy-third-party-programs).

## Support
Please open an issue and leave a detailed description of your problem, feature request, etc.

*Thanks to Arc/Delta for writing and supporting Arcdps, and the Elite Insights team for their excellent parser*
